# SARATHI

Did you know that 68% of medical deaths happen because ambulances get stuck in traffic? This is a big problem because when ambulances can't get through, people in need of urgent medical attention suffer.

The reason this happens is because other vehicles on the road don't know that an ambulance is coming until it's too late, and they can't move out of the way in time. But there's good news - a solution called SARATHI has been developed to help with this problem.

SARATHI is a smart system that can tell other vehicles when an emergency vehicle, like an ambulance, is coming. This means that drivers will know in advance that they need to clear the lane to make way for the ambulance.

With SARATHI, emergency vehicles can get to and from the hospital much more quickly, because they won't get stuck in traffic. This is great news for anyone who needs urgent medical attention, because it means they can get the help they need faster.

SARATHI is not just another invention, it's a game-changer that has the potential to save millions of lives. The impact of this innovative system cannot be overstated. By informing other vehicles of an approaching emergency vehicle, SARATHI ensures that ambulances can get through traffic quickly and reach the hospital in time to save lives.

Think about how many lives could be saved if ambulances could get to patients more quickly. In emergency situations, every second counts. SARATHI can make the difference between life and death by reducing response times and getting patients to the hospital faster.

Moreover, SARATHI is a smart autonomous system, which means that it operates with minimal human intervention. This eliminates the risk of human error and ensures that the system functions flawlessly every time. This means that SARATHI is always ready to assist, no matter what the circumstances.

By implementing SARATHI, we can save countless lives and ensure that people receive the medical attention they need in emergency situations. This innovation has the potential to change the face of emergency response around the world, and we can be part of that change. Let's work together to ensure that SARATHI is adopted widely and saves millions of lives in the years to come.
